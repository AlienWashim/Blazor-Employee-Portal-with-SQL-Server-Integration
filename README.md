# Blazor Employee Portal with SQL Server Integration

## Description

The **Employee Management System** is a modern web application designed to efficiently manage and display employee data. Built using **Blazor** for the front-end framework and **MudBlazor** for the UI components, this application integrates with a **SQL Server** backend to store and retrieve employee information such as **Name**, **Designation**, and **Salary**. This app features an intuitive and responsive interface for a seamless user experience.

### Key Features:
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, and delete employee records.
- **MudBlazor UI**: Sleek, responsive components for an intuitive user interface.
- **Employee Overview**: Displays employee details, including name, designation, and salary.
- **Validation**: Utilizes data annotations to ensure required fields are validated.
- **Employee Timeline**: Interactive timeline for visualizing employee data.
- **User Authentication**: Future feature for user login and authentication.

## What I Have Learned
This project helped me deepen my understanding of **Blazor** and **MudBlazor** components. I learned how to build a full-stack web application by connecting the front-end UI with a back-end **SQL Server** database using **Entity Framework Core**. Additionally, I worked with **form validation**, **UI/UX design**, and **CRUD operations**. 

I also gained experience integrating **MudBlazor** for rich and modern UI components, including **MudCard**, **MudTimeline**, **MudAvatar**, and **MudMenu**, which significantly enhanced the user experience.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Blazor**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **MudBlazor**: A UI component library that provides material design components for Blazor.
- **SQL Server**: For storing and retrieving employee data.
- **Entity Framework Core**: To manage database operations and perform CRUD functions.
- **Bootstrap**: For additional responsive layout and styling.
- **C#**: For writing back-end logic and business logic.
- **Visual Studio**: As the integrated development environment (IDE) for project development.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project management.
